      <h5>Introduction</h5>
      <h6>Problem: Swapping hosts between roles was a tedious manual process</h6>
      <p>
        Twitter runs services from its own datacenters, which are comprised of 
        hosts (computers). Each host belongs to a role, but sometimes, Role A 
        has too many hosts and Role B needs more hosts, so the logical 
        solution is to transfer some hosts from Role A to Role B.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, swapping hosts between roles was a tedious manual process that 
        only administrators could do, which led to burdensome work for admin 
        engineers and long wait times for requesting engineers. 
      </p>
      <h6>Solution: Create a Capacity Dashboard</h6>
      <p>
        My team decided to build a Capacity Dashboard so engineers could easily 
        swap hosts between roles on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
      As the team's UI/UX designer, I led the Capacity Dashboard's design process
      â€”I brainstormed ideas, iterated on mockups, and appiled feedback from our 
      engineers and the project's stakeholders.
